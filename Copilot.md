# Copilot Development Rules

This document outlines the rules and guidelines for developing the KidsMaze project. These rules must be followed by the Copilot AI agent when contributing to the project.

## Project Type
1. This is a Godot project.
2. The project is written in GDScript.

## Scene Management
1. The Copilot AI agent does not create or edit scenes directly.
2. Instead, the Copilot AI agent provides detailed instructions for the user to create or edit scenes.

## Asset Creation
1. If an asset (e.g., image, sound, etc.) is required, the Copilot AI agent will request the user to create it.
2. The request will include a clear and concise description or prompt for the asset.

## General Guidelines
1. Follow best practices for GDScript and Godot development.
2. Ensure all code contributions are well-documented and easy to understand.
3. Respect the existing project structure and conventions.

By adhering to these rules, the Copilot AI agent will ensure consistent and high-quality contributions to the KidsMaze project.
