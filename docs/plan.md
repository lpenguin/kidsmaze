# Implementation Plan: Shapes & Train Prototype Game

## 1. Maze Creation ✅
- ✅ Create maze using TileMap with ground and obstacles layers
- ✅ Add collision shapes to obstacles (bush, rock, tree)
- ✅ Create SVG assets for maze elements:
  - Ground: grass and path tiles
  - Obstacles: bush, rock, and tree tiles
- ✅ Implement atlas-based tileset approach for efficiency

## 2. Shape Implementation ✅
- ✅ Create Shape scene (Node2D) with drag-and-drop logic
- ✅ Add three shape types: circle, square, triangle
- ✅ Implement collision to prevent moving through walls
- ✅ Create SVG assets for shapes with friendly faces

## 3. Door Implementation ✅
- ✅ Create Door scene with cut-out for specific shape
- ✅ Add collision detection and feedback (success/error)
- ✅ Animate door opening and play sounds
- ✅ Implement door-shape type validation

## 4. Train Implementation
- Create Train scene with locomotive and three cars
- Add cut-outs in cars for shapes
- Validate shape placement and provide feedback

## 5. UI Implementation
- Add Retry and Home buttons
- Implement pop-up message system for feedback
- Add audio toggle for background music

## 6. Visuals
- Use temporary assets (Godot primitives or PNGs)
- Implement simple animations (shake, open, bounce)

## 7. Audio
- Add sound effects for actions and feedback
- Include short voice lines and background music

## 8. Game Logic
- Spawn shapes one at a time
- Ensure correct navigation, door, and train car placement
- Handle all collisions and validations

## 9. Testing and Debugging
- Test drag-and-drop, collisions, and feedback
- Debug edge cases and ensure smooth gameplay

## 10. Finalization
- Replace temporary assets with final art
- Polish animations and optimize code
- Test and package for deployment
